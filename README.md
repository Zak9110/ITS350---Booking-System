Assignment 2 – Booking System
Assume you have been tasked with implementing a booking system. Your objective is to record
the ticket owner's name and the corresponding seat number. The seat numbers range from 01
to 155.
1. Implement a binary search tree to record the name of the ticket owner, and the
corresponding seat number. (2 Marks)
2. Implement a method to delete a booked seat trough providing the seat number.
(2 Mark)
Ex: If the booked seats are as following:
133 90 120 144 150
And we want to unbook seat number 144, the remaining booked seats will be:
133 90 120 150
3. Count the number of available seats. (2 Marks)
133 90 120 144 150
For the above example, we have 150 available seats.
4. Show the name of the people who booked the seats. (2 Marks)
5. Show the booked seats that we have after a specific booked seat. (2 Marks)
For example, in the following example, if we pass 133 as an input, we should get 144 and 150.
133 90 120 144 150
Notes:
 Write comments wherever you believe you should.
 The seat numbers start from 01 to 155.
 Using built-in data structures is not allowed.
 You should use the best approach to solve the requirements otherwise you will lose
marks;
 The values of the above examples are shown in the order in which the elements were
inserted.
